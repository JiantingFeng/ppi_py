# ppi-py
## A Python package for scientific discovery using machine learning

Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a framework for statistically rigorous scientific discovery using machine learning.
Given a small amount of gold-standard data and a large amount of unlabeled or low-quality data, prediction-powered inference allows for the estimation of population parameters, such as the mean, median, quantile, OLS coefficients, or logistic coefficients.
Prediction-powered inference can be used both to produce better point-estimates of these quantities as well as tighter confidence intervals and more powerful p-values.
The methods work both in the i.i.d. setting and for certain classees of distribution shifts.

This package is actively maintained, and contributions from the community are welcome.
